        all the time and always being with messi like how they were in the world
        cup</p>

          style='font-size:25px;'>&#128521;</span> </blockquote>
      <p> Ronaldo achived his goal: <q>which was becoming the best player in the

      <h3> I am currently playing my last Euros and im really hoping to win
        it</h3>
      <p> I want to apologize to my fans and say that im really sorry that i
        missed the penalty but sometimes it's hard and difficult to score
        penalties.</p>
      <p> I've scored more than 200 penalties in my career. Sometimes it's a
        mess</p>
      <p>I still wanted to be the first person who steps up to take the first
        penalty for the team because giving up is something you will never see
        or hear from me</p>
